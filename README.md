# Isaac-Modpack-Saver
Saves, Manages, and Loads Isaac Modpacks

### Installation
Place the .exe file in your Isaac Steam game directory.
This should look something like `C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\The Binding of Isaac Rebirth\`

### Usage
Pressing enter on many prompts with nothing typed have special quick functions or exit functions
(ei, entering nothing on the save function will act like creating a backup using time and date, also the only way to exit the edit mode)
